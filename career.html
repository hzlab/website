						<p>The National University of Singapore invites applications for research assistant/associates in the Multimodal Neuroimaging in Neuropsychiatric Disorders Laboratory (MNNDL), Center for Sleep and Cognition at the Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.</p>

						<p>The MNNDL group at NUS studies the human neural bases of cognitive functions and the associated vulnerability patterns in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders using multimodal neuroimaging and psychophysical techniques. We are interested in the large-scale brain structural and functional networks in healthy developing and aging brain and symptoms-related changes in diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and psychosis. Statistical, computational, and machine learning methods are developed to analyze and fuse multimodal neuroimaging data. By integrating longitudinal behavior, neuroimaging, and genotype data, our long-term goal is to investigate the interactions among brain network dynamics, behavior, diseases, and genotypes to develop non-invasive biomarkers for early detection, differential diagnosis, progression monitoring, and treatment design.</p>

						<p>Key attractions are access to a high-performance computing cluster, two 3T Prisma MR scanner and a MR compatible digital EEG system as well as collaboration opportunities with an excellent network of domestic and international scientists and doctors. Appointments will be made on a two-year contract basis in the first instance, with the possibility of extension. Salary and benefits will depend on qualifications and work experience. Long-term commitment is encouraged with mutual satisfaction.</p>


						<p><b>Purpose:</b></p>
						
						<p>The Research Associate/Assistant (RA) will be responsible to, and work closely with, the Principal Investigator, lab members, and collaborators to ensure successful completion of research projects and efficient management of database in the lab.</p>

						<p><b>Main Duties and Responsibilities:</b></p>
						<p>
						The research associate/assistant will support the effort in conducting cutting-edge neuroscience and machine learning research and development. He/she has the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques, data collection and analysis, with healthy participants and patients with neuropsychiatric diseases. He/she will be primarily engaged in all neuroimaging experiments such as subject recruitment, behavioral testing, image data collection, and data analysis, support computing server and storage administration (with support from external vendors), and general lab administration. He/she will also be able to learn how to conduct fMRI scans with EEG recording, interactions with patients, quality control, behavioural assessments, and implications in neuroscience and disease. The research assistant is expected to learn neuroimaging softwares and assist researchers in IRB application, data preprocessing and database management in various research projects. He/she will be exposed to ongoing research work in machine learning and statistical analysis in the context of neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience. The research assistant/associate will have the opportunity to liaise and work with other clinical collaborators across the institutes/hospitals in Singapore on research projects and contribute to the presentations and publications of research work. He/she will assist with any other duties of a similar nature that are delegated by the principal investigator. He/she is expected to maintain the highest standard of professional conduct and record keeping in accordance with policies and procedures.

						<li>A keen interest in scientific enquiry</li>
						<li>Independence</li>
<!-- 						<li>Self-funded (endorsed by school)</li> -->
						<li>A minimum commitment of 3 months (full-time) or 6 months (part-time)</li></p>

					<p>There are usually three intakes each year: May - Aug (vacation), Aug - Jan (school term 1), and Jan - July (school term 2). Application interview and review process usually begins 2 months prior to the intake. Schedule is subject to changes depending on the need and resources in the lab.</p>

					<p>If you are keen to do an internship with our lab, please email both Assoc. Prof. Juan Helen Zhou at <span><a style="color : #002b80" href="mailto:helen.zhou@nus.edu.sg"><u>helen.zhou@nus.edu.sg</u> </a></span>  and cc Dr. Eric Ng at <span><a style="color : #002b80" href="mailto:eric.nkk@nus.edu.sg"><u>eric.nkk@nus.edu.sg</u></a></span> with the application letter, curriculum vitae, transcript, and the possible letter of endorsement/school requirements.</p>
